Weather Application

Overview

This project is a beginner-friendly weather application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It dynamically fetches live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, allowing users to search for current conditions in any city. Upon entering a city name, the app displays real-time temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an illustrative weather icon that adapts to various conditions such as clear skies, rain, snow, or mist. With a clean UI, responsive layout, and intuitive search functionality, this app is a great starting point for exploring API integration and interactive web design. Error handling ensures smooth user experience, while modular JavaScript functions keep the logic organized. Ideal for those learning front-end development, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous data fetching.
